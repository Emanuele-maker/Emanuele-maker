# ABOUT ME
Hi! I'm Manu and i'm full-time student but in my free time i love to make games. I mainly use Javascript (using Canvas APIs) and Python (using Pygame).
At the moment my games are really simple, but i made them just to practice. In the future you will see more complex games like 1v1 based game, a really well-written storyline game
and a 3D spying game.
